# Nested_Dictionaries_and_Lists

<h1>Assignment: Nested Dictionaries & Lists</h1>

<b>Welcome to another Core assignment!</b> Some students like to explore the assignments before they're finished reading through the lessons, and that's okay! It can be good for your brain to have a preview of what your future challenges might be. However, before you begin this assignment, it's important that you've first:<br>

<li>Completed the preceding lesson modules</li>
<li>Taken the knowledge checks to confirm your understanding</li>
<li>Viewed lecture material related to the assignment topics</li>
<li>Completed and submitted your practice assignments</li>

<h2>Now, the Assignment:</h2>
<h3>Note: Avoid using class keywords like int, str, list, and dict as variable/parameter names.</h3>

<b>1. Update Values in Dictionaries and Lists</b>

<ol>1. Change the value 10 in x to 15. Once you're done, x should now be [ [5,2,3], [15,8,9] ].</ol>
<ol>2. Change the last_name of the first student from 'Jordan' to 'Bryant'</ol>
<ol>3. In the sports_directory, change 'Messi' to 'Andres'</ol>
<ol>4. Change the value 20 in z to 30</ol>

<b>2. Iterate Through a List of Dictionaries</b>

Create a function <i>iterateDictionary(some_list)</i> that, given a list of dictionaries, the function loops through each dictionary in the list and prints each key and the associated value. For example, given the following list:

<b>3. Get Values From a List of Dictionaries</b>

Create a function <i>iterateDictionary2(key_name, some_list)</i> that, given a list of dictionaries and a key name, the function prints the value stored in that key for each dictionary. For example, iterateDictionary2('first_name', students) should output:

And iterateDictionary2('last_name', students) should output:

<b>4. Iterate Through a Dictionary with List Values</b>

Create a function <i>printInfo(some_dict)</i> that given a dictionary whose values are all lists, prints the name of each key along with the size of its list, and then prints the associated values within each key's list. For example:
